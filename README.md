# CCMS (CSH's Content Management System)

This is a very old CMS that I wrote around 2007. This was before (I understood/knew about) AJAX and it uses iframes to allow a java script backend communication

It was written in PHP4 or maybe PHP5, it won't fully run in PHP > 5 (yet).

In other words:.... a blast from the past...
